# Archived Files

These are old files that have no use in the current iteration of the goldfleck pipeline. 

The nextflow script in particular (and associated files) (main.nf, nextflow.config, params.schema.json) may be
returned to at some unknown point in the future, but for now (8/29/25) they aren't useful. Pipeline execution 
should use the main.sh shell script in the project root.
